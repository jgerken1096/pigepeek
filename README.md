# pigepeek
Bot for pigepeek server

Channels must be appropriately named via the emoji keys in helpers.py / pigepeek_emoji_ids_dic.
An example for a channel name for one using the ":pigepeek:" emoji, would be, "pigepeek"

Data is managed through csv files. The csv file will be created at bot startup if the file does not already exist.
